## Layers
* Common -> It contains certain components that are useful and stable for the application, independent of other layers.
* Navigation -> The screens present in the application and the navigation and state information triggered by user interaction are kept in this layer.
* DI -> It is a separated layer in the application that aims to eliminate external dependencies and automate these dependencies. The dependencies of all layers are executed through this layer.
* Notification -> Business logic related to setting alarms and sending notifications in the application is kept in this layer.
* Feature -> Each feature in the application creates its own layers for independence, testability and a modular approach.
    - Data -> Here, models are available for the local database, parsers, and data from the remote source.
    - Domain -> The domain layer of the application includes the fundamental and independent components such as the main logic, business rules, and data models. This layer does not communicate with other layers and remains independent from external dependencies.
    - Presentation -> It is the layer to interact with the user. This layer receives user inputs, triggers related actions and displays the results.
